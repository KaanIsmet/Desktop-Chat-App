# Desktop-Chat-App
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the capabilities of C programming and how it can be used to communicate between end-systems by using socket programming and the GTK+.
The program will use GTK+ for the frontend, and use socket libraries for the backend.
Essentially this is a chat application, so there's going to be users creating their accounts, logging in, and communicating. 
This is to ensure that the program will be able to store vital information and let the user connect communicate with one another.
The program will use TCP to have a secure connection between the end-systems and to not have any sort of data loss.
The program will also store the information such as the user's IP addresses in a binary file (This file will not be include in this public repository).
